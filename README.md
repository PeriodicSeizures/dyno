modern ssh server library using asio

## overview
I am not responsible for the decisions of others to use this library and run into security issues. I have no clue what I'm doing and am therefore not liable for anything on your end.

With that out of the way, I am working on this library after seeing the current selection of SSH libraries. Especially those for servers. There are very few, and among those, they are very complicated to set up a small-little server.

The objectives of this project is to create a robust and secure SSH server library with ease of use with automatic networking stuff thanks to asio.

Development will be slow in the next few months while I become familiar with SSH protocol.
